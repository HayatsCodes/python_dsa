# Algorithm
# It is a set of steps that solve a problem

# Algorithm guidelines:
# 1. It must have a clearly defined problem statement
# 2. Algorithm definition must contain a specific set of instructions in a particular order.
# 3. Each steps of the algorithm should be simplified
# 4. It should produce a result
# 5. It should complete and cannot take infinite amount of time.

# Big O:
# This is a notation that is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm
# The common notations are:
# Polynomial runtimes O(n^k):
    # O(1) - constant time: it always takes the same time to execute the algorithm.
    # O(log n) - logarithmic time: it takes the log of n + 1 to execute the algorithm.
    # O(n) - linear time: it increases as the amount of input increases
    # O(n^2) - quadratic time: it takes the square of the input to complete the algorithm
    # O(n log n) - Quasilinear time
# Exponential runtimes O(x^n):
    # Brute force algorithm
